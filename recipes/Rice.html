                <p>This is it—the foolproof recipe for making perfect rice on the stove. If cooking rice makes you nervous, know that you are not alone. </p>
                <p>Even really accomplished cooks get intimidated by plain old rice.</p>
                <h2>What is the Ratio of Water to Rice?</h2>
                
                      <p>The basic water to white rice ratio is 2 cups water to 1 cup rice.</p>
                      <p>You can easily, double and even triple the recipe; just make sure you are using a pot large enough to hold the rice as it cooks and expands.</p>
                      <p> Other rice varieties, like brown and Arborio, can be a little different in terms of proportions and timing, but this 2 to 1 ratio is how you’ll get perfect white rice every time.</p>

              <div class="steps">
                  <ol>
                    <li><p>Gather the ingredients.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain in a colander and set aside.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Add the salt, stir, and then add the rinsed and drained rice. Stir with a fork.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 20 minutes. Check it after 15 minutes to see if all the water has evaporated. If it has, the rice is ready. If not, replace the lid and let the rice simmer an additional 5 minutes. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Remove from the heat and fluff with a fork. Transfer to a plate and serve garnished with butter and parsley, if desired.</p></li>
